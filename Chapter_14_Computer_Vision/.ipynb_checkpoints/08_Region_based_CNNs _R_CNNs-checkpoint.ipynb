    "# 1.  R-CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The R-CNN first extracts many (e.g., 2000) region proposals from the input image (e.g., anchor boxes can also be considered as region proposals), labeling their classes and bounding boxes (e.g., offsets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a CNN is used to perform forward propagation on each region proposal to extract its features. Next, features of each region proposal are used for predicting the class and bounding box of this region proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img1.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "More concretely, the R-CNN consists of the following four steps:\n",
    "1. Perform selective search to extract multiple high-quality region proposals on the input image. These proposed regions are usually selected at multiple scales with different shapes and sizes. Each region proposal will be labeled with a class and a ground-truth bounding box.\n",
    "2. Choose a pretrained CNN and truncate it before the output layer. Resize each region proposal to the input size required by the network, and output the extracted features for the region proposal through forward propagation.\n",
    "3. Take the extracted features and labeled class of each region proposal as an example. Train multiple support vector machines to classify objects, where each support vector machine individually determines whether the example contains a specific class.\n",
    "4. Take the extracted features and labeled bounding box of each region proposal as an example. Train a linear regression model to predict the ground-truth bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the R-CNN model uses pretrained CNNs to effectively extract image features, it is slow. Imagine that we select thousands of region proposals from a single input image: this requires thousands of CNN forward propagations to perform object detection. This massive computing load makes it infeasible to widely use R-CNNs in real-world applications.\n",
