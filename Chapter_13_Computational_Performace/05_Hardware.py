Building systems with great performance requires a good understanding of the algorithms and models to capture the
statistical aspects of the problem. At the same time it is also indispensable to have at least a modicum of knowledge
of the underlying hardware. The current section is no substitute for a proper course on hardware and system design.
Instead, it might serve as a starting point for understanding why some algorithms are more efficient than others and how
to  achieve good throughput. A good design can easily make a difference of an order of magnitude and, in turn,
this can make the difference between being able to train a network (e.g., in a week) and not at all (in 3 months,
thus missing the deadline). We will start by looking at computers. Then we will zoom in to look more carefully at
CPUs and GPUs. Lastly we zoom out to review how multiple computers are connected in a server center or in the cloud.
